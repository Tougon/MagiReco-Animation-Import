# MagiReco-Animation-Import
Old tool that allows one to import animation from Magia Record to Unity. This was made before I truly understood JSON and is kind of messy, but it should work correctly.<br/>

Instructions:<br/>
1: Acquire MagiReco animation data and put into your Unity project's resources folder.<br/>
2: With the .png sprite sheet selected, click Character/Import From MagiReco from the menu.<br/>
3: Select the .plist and .ExportJson files associated with the character in the pop-ups.<br/>
4: The generated animations will appear in "animations/*character's ID*"<br/>
